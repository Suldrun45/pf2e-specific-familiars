# PF2e Specific Familiars - module handling specific familiars for Pathfinder 2e

- Adds a compendium with a series of Familiar Abilities defining each Specific Familiar
- Dragging one of these Abilities to a familiar actor will also add every other Familiar Ability granted to the familiar
- Candies for the Sweet Beasts familiars

### Please note
- As the Aeon Wyrd, the Construct Familiar and the Poppet have the Construct trait, and that, in the Remaster, this trait adds an immunity to Spirit, Vitality and Void damage, those 3 familiars will get that immunity too despite not having it in their description.

### How to
The module provides a macro that you can use while selecting the token of the Master of the familiar.  
When you use this macro, the Number of abilities required to get that specific familiar will be deducted from the Total # of familiar abilities on the character sheet.  
You will have to reexecute the macro every time the type of specific familiar changes or if you remove it to force a refresh.  

If you use PF2e Dailies, using this macro will allow that module to show the right number dropdowns to select the remaining familiar abilities.
