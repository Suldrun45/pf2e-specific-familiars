# PF2e Specific Familiars - module handling specific familiars for Pathfinder 2e

- Adds a compendium with a series of Familiar Abilities defining each Specific Familiar
- Dragging one of these Abilities to a familiar actor will also add every other Familiar Ability granted to the familiar
- Candies for the Sweet Beasts familiars

### Please note
- As the Aeon Wyrd, the Construct Familiar and the Poppet have the Construct trait, and that, in the Remaster, this trait adds an immunity to Spirit damage, those 3 familiars will get that immunity too despite not having it in their description, which was written before the Spirit damage was introduced to PF2e.
- The Talking Head familiar has a base land speed of 15 feet. Due to this, the base familiar ability Fast Movement: Land will only give it a land speed of 30 feet instead of 40 feet. There is a Fast Movement: Land (Talking Head) in this module that will grant this familiar the 40 feet land speed. It should not be used on any other familiar.
