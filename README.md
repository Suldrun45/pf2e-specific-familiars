# PF2e Specific Familiars - module handling specific familiars for Pathfinder 2e

- Adds a compendium with a series of Familiar Abilities defining each Specific Familiar
- Dragging one of these Abilities to a familiar actor will also add every other Familiar Ability granted to the familiar
- Candies for the Sweet Beasts familiars

### Please note
- As the Aeon Wyrd, the Construct Familiar and the Poppet have the Construct trait, and that, in the Remaster, this trait adds an immunity to Spirit, Vitality and Void damage, those 3 familiars will get that immunity too despite not having it in their description.

### Incompatibilities
- This module has compatibility issues with PF2e Dailies management of Familiar abilities.  
The Familiar Abilities from this module are not recognized by PF2e Dailies. When you click the Daily Preparations button, they will be removed from the familiar sheet and you won't get the option to select them back from the dropdowns.  
As a workaround if you want to use both modules together, you can go to the PF2e Dailies settings and type `dailies.familiar` in the `Filter Out Dailies` field.  
Please note that this will disable the Familiars part of PF2e Dailies.
Starting with the version 3.0.0 of PF2e Dailies, this filter is now a "per character" option and can be accessed by clicking the `filters` button in the header of the daily preparation interface of the module.
