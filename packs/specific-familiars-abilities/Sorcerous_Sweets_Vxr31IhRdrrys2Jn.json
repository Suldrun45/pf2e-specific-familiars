The candy is an item with the arcane, consumable and transmutation traits.</p><p>Anyone who eats the candy as an Interact action gains a +1 item bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Performance checks for 1 hour (this increases to +2 at level 9, and +3 at level 17). The candy maintains its enchantment until your next daily preparations.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-specific-familiars.specific-familiars-equipments.Item.lEe3qsmk2nRwZybH]{Sorcerous Sweets Candy}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-specific-familiars.specific-familiars-equipments.Item.lgbWrT72bCMERszr]{Sorcerous Sweets Candy (Level 9)}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-specific-familiars.specific-familiars-equipments.Item.p08ulJpjgrqinPKa]{Sorcerous Sweets Candy (Level 17)}</p>"
