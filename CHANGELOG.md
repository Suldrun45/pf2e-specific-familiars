## Version 1.1.0
- When you add or remove a Specific Familiar ability to a familiar, a bonus feat is added to the master. This feat is used to deduct automatically the Required number of abilities from the Familiar's Total number of abilities.
- If the familiar has automatic abilities (like Scent for the Corgi Mount for example), these will also be deducted from the Familiar's Total number of abilities.
